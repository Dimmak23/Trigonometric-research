# Trigonometric-research

This program compare results:

#1. Of calculation y=cos(x) / y=sin(x) (where x - input in degree values, y - output in double) for numeric equation of Maclaurin sequence
and inner function cos(int var)/ sin(int var).

#2. Encrease members of Maclaurin sequence for achievement necessary precision of calculation cos(x) and sin(x).

Instructions for input:

#1. Enter precision of calculation, number of true decimals; If precision of calculations appears to be too low program increase K - quantity of Maclaurin sequence members.

#2. Enter argument x in degree values!

#3. Know that program also working for x > 360 deg., in case of this values it simply cut x between [0; 360].
